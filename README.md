# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Here's an updated summary incorporating a dialog system to boost user engagement:

### Project Overview

- **Platform:** A simple website.
- **Modes:** Two modes—Normal and Hard.
- **Data Structure:**  
  Each dinosaur will have data structured like:  
  ```js
  {
    name: "Tyrannosaurus Rex",
    image: "tyrannosaurus-rex.png",
    period: "Cretaceous",
    fullPeriod: "Late Cretaceous",
    yearsMya: { start: 68, end: 66 },
    difficulty: 1  // 1 (easy) to 3 (hard)
  }
  ```
- **Period Groups:**  
  - Late Triassic  
  - Early Jurassic  
  - Mid Jurassic  
  - Late Jurassic  
  - Early Cretaceous  
  - Late Cretaceous  
  *(Each with corresponding mya ranges)*

### Quiz Mechanics

#### Landing Page
- **Title:** “Dino Quiz”
- **Buttons:** Two options—“Start Quiz” (normal mode) and “Hard Mode”
- **Navigation:** A consistent “back to menu” button on quiz pages.

#### Quiz Structure
- **Questions:** Each quiz will consist of 4 multiple-choice questions.
- **Normal Mode:**  
  - **Question:** “What period did [Dinosaur Name] live in?”
  - **Answer Choices:** Generated by taking the dinosaur’s correct period and adding three distractor periods from adjacent period groups, ordered chronologically.
  
- **Hard Mode:**  
  - **Question:** Uses specific mya ranges.  
  - **Answer Choices:**  
    - The correct answer is the dinosaur’s specific `yearsMya` data.
    - Three distractor options are generated from the nearest period groups' date ranges.
    - The distractors are chosen based on proximity on the timeline (either earlier or later) and are ordered chronologically.

### UI, Feedback, and Dialog System

- **Interactivity & Visual Feedback:**  
  - When a user selects an answer:
    - **Correct:** The answer box lights up green.
    - **Incorrect:** The chosen option turns red and the correct answer highlights in blue for a few seconds.
  
- **Scoring System:**  
  - Track the number of questions attempted, correct answers, and overall percentage.
  
- **Dialog System:**  
  - **Purpose:** Provide periodic motivational feedback and status updates.
  - **Mechanism:** Hooks integrated into the game logic trigger feedback every 10 levels (or at another predetermined interval).
  - **Feedback Examples:**  
    - Text-based compliments (e.g., “Nice, you’re killing it!”)
    - Fun, visual cues (e.g., fire emojis)
  - **Implementation:**  
    - The dialog system listens for specific game milestones and then displays dialog messages in a designated area of the UI.  
    - This encourages users and provides positive reinforcement as they progress through the quiz.
  
- **Visual Enhancements:**  
  - Initially include a static image or placeholder for a dinosaur animation above the answer options.
  - Plan for dynamic animations in future updates.

### Technical Considerations

1. **Data Management:**  
   - Store dinosaur data in a JSON file or a JavaScript module.
   - Maintain a mapping of period groups and their mya ranges for efficient distractor generation.
   
2. **Quiz Logic:**  
   - **Distractor Generation:**  
     - *Normal Mode:* Select adjacent periods relative to the correct answer.
     - *Hard Mode:* Compute the nearest mya ranges for creating distractor options.
   - **Randomization:**  
     - Ensure that both questions and distractors are dynamically generated to provide variety.
     
3. **UI Development:**  
   - Consider a single-page application framework (like React or Vue) or vanilla JavaScript for dynamic content.
   - Implement a responsive design for desktop and mobile users.

4. **Future Scalability:**  
   - The modular design allows for easy addition of more dinosaurs.
   - Future features can include enhanced dialog feedback, leaderboards, and user analytics.

This updated architecture not only covers the core quiz functionality but also adds an engaging dialog system to keep users motivated as they progress through the game. Let me know if there’s any other aspect you’d like to dive deeper into!
